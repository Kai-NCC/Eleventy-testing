Everything below this line (`<hr>`), including the line itself, has been written in Markdown. This is because classes cannot be added to elements in Markdown, i.e. the `<p>` element with the class "lead" was written as HTML in the 'source' file for this page. 

The following two screenshots will make this idea more clear:

![Screenshot showing the .md file for this page](/NCC-Design-System/public/img/md-guide-md.png "Markdown code screenshot")

So that should give a rough idea of how the Markdown files are structured in relation to the rest of the files. Here are a few key things to note:

- The file directories for the files for a page are slightly different. You can find the raw HTML/Nunjucks files in the _includes/_sources folder.
