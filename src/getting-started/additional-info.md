## Inspiration

### Material Design by Google

Material Design informs the way things look and behave in the skeleton of our digital offerings. Whites, light greys and shadows are the foundation of our visual identity.

### AirBnB

Our components and interactive behaviours are heavily inspired by AirBnB. This is due to it being designed for accessibility and simplicity. It also slots together nicely with Material Design elements.

### Gov UK

With user considerations and simplicity at the core of their offering Gov UK has spearheaded a new direction on design. Task based user experience and semantic markup.
