### When to use

The timeline is a simple component with a well defined use case. Use it to connect date/text pairs.

### Where it appears

The timeline is responsive and works well at all screen sizes, but it works best when it has its own section within the page. 

### Anatomy

2. Text

The timeline can be light or dark. The dark option is the default, but light mode can be toggled with the '.backdrop-timeline-light' class.
